# CliMT-heatwaves 
This is the repository for a project which aims to sample and study heatwaves in an idealised AGCM on the CliMT framework - <https://github.com/CliMT/climt>

### Repository Index
#### Model
* Code for the model we use for the project.
* Scripts to perform spinup and compute the climatology of the model, and to visualise the model.
* Script to create an observation mask for heatwaves.

#### Direct_run

* Slurm code to perform a long run of the model and save model data.

#### GKLT_run

* Slurm framework to run the GKLT algorithm over the model.
